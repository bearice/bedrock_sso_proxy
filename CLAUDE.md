## Development Best Practices

- If there is any functional update, update DESIGN.md too
- You should always follow design in DESIGN.md when coding
- After each phase, do a commit and make it easy to review and rewind
- When adding a dep, make sure it's the latest version
- Before commit, use cargo clippy to check code and cargo fmt to format
- You should add tests for new code when a phase is finished

## Project Workflow Notes

- When clearing context between phases, summarize key changes and prepare notes for the next phase of development
- Keep track of context clearing to ensure continuity and understanding of project progression
